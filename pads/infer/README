This directory contains a PADS Inference System for inferring a description
of newline-separated ASCII data.  

1. Requirements:
   You must have sml/nj 110.64 or later, available from www.smlnj.org.
   You must have PADS 2.00 or later, available from www.padsproj.org.

2. You must set the LEARN_HOME environment variable to the root of the
   PADS Inference System distribution.

3. To compile the learning program, just type "make" in the $LEARN_HOME
   directory.  This will compile the source files in the src directory
   and put the sml/nj heap image in the directory lib.  The script
   that invokes the system is in the scripts directory.  You might
   want to add $LEARN_HOME/scripts to you search path.

4. The "learn" program takes a data file input and produces an 
   intermediate representation (IR) and also prints out the PADS
   description. For details of the usage of "learn", type:
   
   $LEARN_HOME> scripts/learn --help 

   PADS Learning System 1.0
   learn  [-d <string>] [-n <string>] [-maxdepth <int>] [-lineNos] 
   [-ids] [-h <float>] [-s <float>] [-noise <float>] [-a <int>] 
   [-ma <int>] [-j <float>] [-e] [-lex <string>] [-au <string> ...] 
   [--help] files...

   -d      output directory (default gen/)
   -n      name of output file (default generatedDescription)
   -maxdepth       maximum depth for exploration (default 50)
   -lineNos        print line numbers in output contexts (default false)
   -ids    print ids in type and tokens matching base types (default false)
   -h      histogram comparison tolerance (percentage, default 0.01)
   -s      struct determination tolerance (percentage, default 0.1)
   -noise  noise level (percentage, default 0.0)
   -a      array width requirement (default 4)
   -ma     minimum array width (default 0)
   -j      junk threshold (percentage, default 0.1)
   -e      Print entropy tokens (default false)
   -lex    prefix of the lex config to be used (default "vanilla")
   -au     run only the golden file

   For example, 

   >scripts/learn examples/data/crashreporter.log

   will generate in the infer/gen directory a Ty which contains the IR, 
   and crashreporter.log.p which is the PADS description. In addition,
   a number of tools avilable to this data source in the form of .c
   files are generated in the same directory. For data source XYZ,
   XYZ-accum.c is the accumulator tool, XYZ-xml.c is the XML tool, 
   XYZ-fmt.c is the formatting tool, XYZ-graph is the grapher too etc. 
   For example, to build the accumulator tool for crashreporter.log, do:
   
   >cd gen/
   >make crashreporter.log-accum

   To build the xml tool, do:
   >make crashreporter.log-xml

   To build the fmt tool, do:
   >make crashreporter.log-fmt

   Executable programs crashreporter.log-accum and crashreporter.log-xml
   will be created in directory gen/ARCH, where ARCH is a string that
   represents the OS and the CPU architecture, such as darwin.ppc and 
   linux.i386.

   To run the accumulator, xml-conversion, and formatting programs,
   >ARCH/crashreporter.log-accum ../examples/data/crashreporter.log
   >ARCH/crashreporter.log-xml ../examples/data/crashreporter.log
   >ARCH/crashreporter.log-fmt ../examples/data/crashreporter.log

   The grapher tool is a generated Perl script. To run the
   grapher tool, one has to first make the formatting tool by doing:
   >make crashreporter.log-fmt 
   as above

   and then execute
   >./crashreporter.log-graph 

   to see detailed usage of the grapher. And example of use is:

   ai.3000-graph -d ../data/ai.3000 -x 3 -y 8 -s impulses -t "%H:%M:%S"

5. The directory examples contains the subdirectory data with many
   sample data sources.  The example directory contains a README file
   explaining how to run the inference tool on these data source and
   put the results in the results directory, one sub-directory per
   data source.
